This is a stupid simple flask app that takes key/values with timestamps.

It does a very terrible job of that.

Some planned improvements I have:
* stop using sqlite, duh
* prolly switch to RRDs or whisper (graphite)
* maybe should use opentsdb or cassandra
* I'm gonna try to D3 some simple scatterplots/linegraphs a la http://dealloc.me/2011/06/24/d3-is-not-a-graphing-library.html
* build up some tools for mass import of historical data
